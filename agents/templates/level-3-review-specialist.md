# [Specialist Name] Review Specialist

## How to Use This Template

This template creates a Level 3 review specialist - an expert in a specific review domain.

### Steps to Create a New Specialist

1. **Replace ALL [PLACEHOLDER] text** with domain-specific content
1. **Define clear boundaries** in "Scope" section (what IS and ISN'T covered)
1. **Customize responsibilities** (keep 4-6 main areas)
1. **Update delegation table** with related specialists
1. **Create 3-4 example reviews** showing common issues in your domain
1. **Customize checklist items** for your review focus
1. **Update success criteria** to match your specialist's goals

### Key Principles

- **Narrow focus**: Each specialist has ONE clear domain
- **No overlap**: Define what you DON'T review (delegate to others)
- **Actionable feedback**: Provide specific fixes, not vague suggestions
- **Severity levels**: Use CRITICAL (🔴), MAJOR (🟠), MINOR (🟡), EXCELLENT (✅)
- **Example-driven**: Show code examples with issues and fixes

### Common Level 3 Specialist Types

- Code quality (implementation, security, performance, safety)
- Language-specific (Mojo patterns, Python best practices)
- Domain-specific (ML algorithms, data structures, API design)
- Test quality (coverage, edge cases, test design)
- Documentation quality (clarity, completeness, accuracy)

## Output Location

**CRITICAL**: All review feedback MUST be posted directly to the GitHub pull request.

```bash
# Post review comment to PR
gh pr review <pr-number> --comment --body "[Your review feedback]"

# Or reply to specific review comments
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies \
  --method POST -f body="[Your response]"
```

**NEVER** write reviews to:

- `notes/review/` directory (reserved for architectural specs only)
- Local files
- Issue comments (use PR review comments instead)

## Template Customization Guide

### 1. Defining Your Specialist's Domain

**Good Domain Definitions** (narrow, clear):

- "Security vulnerability detection in authentication/authorization code"
- "SIMD and vectorization optimization in Mojo"
- "Test coverage and edge case validation"
- "API design and interface contracts"

**Bad Domain Definitions** (too broad, overlapping):

- "Code quality" (too vague - split into multiple specialists)
- "Everything related to Python" (too broad)
- "Making code better" (unclear boundaries)

### 2. Creating Clear Boundaries

For each responsibility, ask:

- **Is this EXCLUSIVELY my domain?** If shared, delegate to orchestrator
- **Can I review this WITHOUT another specialist?** If no, it's coordinated work
- **Would another specialist also review this?** If yes, define who owns what

### 3. Writing Effective Examples

**Critical Issue Example Template**:

- Show code that will fail/cause harm
- Explain EXACTLY why it's dangerous
- Provide COMPLETE fix with explanation
- Include edge cases and scenarios

**Major Issue Example Template**:

- Show suboptimal but working code
- List multiple issues clearly
- Provide improved version
- Explain benefits of improvement

**Minor Issue Example Template**:

- Show code that works but could be better
- Suggest refinement
- Show how refinement helps

**Excellent Code Example Template**:

- Show best-practice implementation
- List all strengths specifically
- Explain why this is exemplary
- NO changes needed

### 4. Checklist Items

Each checklist item should be:

- **Specific**: Can be checked yes/no
- **Actionable**: Reviewer knows what to look for
- **Measurable**: Clear pass/fail criteria
- **Domain-focused**: Directly related to specialist's area

**Good**: "Authentication tokens are validated before use"
**Bad**: "Security is good"

### 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Overlapping responsibilities with other specialists
- ❌ Vague, non-actionable feedback ("make this better")
- ❌ Missing concrete examples
- ❌ Unclear severity levels
- ❌ No positive feedback (only criticism)
- ❌ Reviewing outside your domain
- ❌ Not escalating when needed
